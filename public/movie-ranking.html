<h3>3rd - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2</h3>
<p>This is the final installment in the Harry Potter series. The climax of the saga brings us on an unexpected journey to a expected conclusion, it ended the only way it could, but the journey was fun.</p>

<h3>2nd - Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince</h3>
<p>This was the first of the series that showed the characters less as children with child issues but instead like they had a stake in the fight agains Voldomort.</p>

<h3>1st - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1</h3>
<p>This was the literal coming of age for Harry, as he turned 17 and no longer underage for practicing magic.  This was a pivital moment and distinction for the remainder of the series as he got closer and closer in the hunt for Voldomort.</p>
