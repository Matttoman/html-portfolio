    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        In my limited free time, (I have two young boys that keep me very busy) I enjoy working
        with my hands.  I make a lot of "shop" projects in hopes of someday being able to
        efficently make other projects.  My "Honey-Do List" is always growing and I try to get
        one of the things on it ticked off every so often, but never enough and never soon enough,
        (my words not my lovely wifes).
    </p>
    <p>
        I want my hobbies to include going to the gym and cooking. Maybe someday those will be the
        things I want to do more than go in the garage and tinker.
